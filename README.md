Hi — I’m Usman.

I’m a CS + Math student at UT Arlington focused on building and operating production-grade software systems, with an emphasis on backend engineering, infrastructure, and internal tooling.

I enjoy working on systems that handle real users, real data, and real constraints, reliability, performance, and maintainability matter to me more than demos.

### What I work on
- Backend services and APIs
- Infrastructure and operational tooling
- Internal dashboards, automation, and data pipelines
- AI-enabled systems with practical, production-oriented use cases

### Selected projects
- **Cognivo** — Data visualization platform that ingests CSV/Excel files and generates interactive dashboards using AI-assisted analysis.  
  *Focus areas:* API design, async processing, data pipelines, state persistence.

- **MindFlow** — Conversational mind-mapping tool for structuring ideas and knowledge.  
  *Focus areas:* real-time state management, graph modeling, AI orchestration.

I’m currently interested in roles where I can own a scoped system end-to-end — from design and implementation to deployment and operation.
